# Hello, World!

I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer with a passion for creating through technology.

Whether engineering video solutions for developers, creating interactive and responsive design-driven user interfaces, or developing and testing full stack CRUD applications with RESTful APIs, I'm a results-driven engineer with proficiency across the broader web tech stack.

I live in the Greater Los Angeles Area with my corgis Evie & Obi-Wan.
